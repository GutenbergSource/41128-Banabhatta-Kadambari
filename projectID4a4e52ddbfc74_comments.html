<HTML><BODY><p style="color: red">I noticed a few proofers use ['S] to indicate the letter Ç (as in Çiva). Although this is an old-fashioned transcription of &#2358;, and current transcriptions use &#346;, please don't use it, and transcribe the letter you actually see, that is, write Çiva.

<p>The Ka&#772;dambari&#772; of Ba&#772;n&#803;a, (or Ba&#772;n&#803;abhat&#803;t&#803;a) here presented in its 1896 English translation. This is a Sanskrit work that dates back to some years after 600. As common in Sanskrit works, this is a complex story, with several layers of stories within stories.

<p>This work should present no special problems to proofers or formatters. The usual Sanskrit dotted letters appear, and should be typed as in the general instructions. The transcription is reasonable by today standards, but uses ç where modern transcription use &#347;. The inset section headers should be moved above the paragraph they appear in, as if they where normal section headers.

<p>Please use wordcheck during P1, so we can collect correctly spelled Sanskrit names for this work.

<p>Have Fun!
